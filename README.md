## Rules
The goal of the game is to win three tic tac toe games in a line before your opponent.

Every move you make changes where your opponent can make their next move. For example, if you play in the top right corner of a square then your opponent will have to play in the top right box. When a center square is played, a box is won, or a box is tied then your opponent can play anywhere. The availble boxes will be highlighted in red.

Tied boxes count for each player.
